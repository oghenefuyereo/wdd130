    <h2>Oghenefuyere Okiotorhoro</h2>
    <p>I previously worked for severe organisations in Nigeria. As detailed in my profile and resume,
        I have ensured to use my skills to bring rapid growth to organisations, as they can testify, 
        <br>before I move to Canada to further my education and improve myself. I am currently studying 
        <br>Graphic Design at Niagara College's Welland Campus and software development 
        at Young Brigham University in Idaho.</p>
